Welcome to [Weather Analysis 🌎🌦️☔️]!

# Introduction
This repository houses the code and resources for analyzing and exploring weather data in different locations. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/weather-data 

# Analyzing and Exploring Data
The data analysis and exploration are performed using Python programming language. I utilize various Python libraries and tools to gain insights, visualize patterns, build predictive models and compare which one is more useful to predict the precipitation.
